# Trello Integration for Autohive

Connects Autohive to the Trello API to enable board management, list organization, card tracking, and team collaboration automation.

## Description

This integration provides a comprehensive connection to Trello's project management platform. It allows users to automate card creation, board management, list organization, and workflow automation directly from Autohive.

The integration uses Trello REST API v1 with API Key and Token authentication and implements 18 actions covering members, boards, lists, cards (including search), checklists, and comments.

Built against `autohive-integrations-sdk ~= 2.0.0`. Handlers return an `ActionResult` on success and an `ActionError(message=...)` on failure — there is no more `result: false / error: "..."` envelope in the action output.

## Setup & Authentication

This integration uses **custom authentication** with Trello API Key and Token for secure access to your Trello account.

### Authentication Method

The integration uses API Key and Token authentication:
- **API Key** - Your public Trello API Key
- **API Token** - Your secret Trello API Token with required permissions

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Get Your API Key

1. Visit https://trello.com/power-ups/admin
2. Select your Power-Up or create a new one
3. Navigate to the "API Key" tab
4. Generate a new API Key if you haven't already
5. Copy your API Key

#### 2. Get Your API Token

1. After obtaining your API Key, click the "Token" link on the same page
2. Authorize the application to access your Trello account
3. Select the permissions you want to grant:
   - Read access to your boards and cards
   - Write access to create/update boards, lists, and cards
   - Account access to read your member information
4. Copy the generated token

#### 3. Configure in Autohive

1. Add Trello integration in Autohive
2. Enter your API Key in the "API Key" field
3. Enter your API Token in the "API Token" field
4. Save your credentials

The integration will use these credentials for all API requests.

## Action Results

Handlers return:
- `ActionResult(data=...)` on success — the `data` payload contains only the action-specific fields (e.g. `board`, `card`, `cards`, `count`).
- `ActionError(message="...")` on failure (non-2xx Trello responses, missing required inputs, network errors, etc.). The Autohive runtime surfaces `ActionError.message` to the caller; the action's `output_schema` describes only the success shape.

Example successful response (`get_board`):
```json
{ "board": { "id": "abc123", "name": "My Board" } }
```

Example successful list response (`list_cards`):
```json
{ "cards": [{ "id": "c1", "name": "First card" }], "count": 1 }
```

Example failure: an `ActionError` is returned with `message`, e.g. `"Board not found"`.

Returns cards on a list or board with **cursor-based pagination**. Uses Trello's documented `limit` + `before`/`since` parameters on `/lists/{id}/cards` and `/boards/{id}/cards` (see [Atlassian's Paging guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/api-introduction/#paging)).

- `board_id` (optional): The ID of the board (use this or list_id)
- `filter` (optional): Filter cards - "all", "open", "closed", "visible" (default: "open")
- `limit` (optional): Server-side cap on cards per request, 1-1000 (default: 50)
- `before` (optional): Cursor — only return cards created before this card ID or ISO 8601 date. Pass the previous response's `next_before` here to fetch the next page.
- `since` (optional): Cursor — only return cards created after this card ID or ISO 8601 date.
- `fields` (optional): Comma-separated card fields, or "all" (default: compact set). Enforced client-side as well as via the API.

**Note:** Either `list_id` or `board_id` is required.

**Outputs:**
- `cards`: Array of card objects
- `count`: Number of cards returned
- `next_before` (optional): Cursor for the next page (the lexicographically smallest card ID in this response, i.e. the oldest-created card). Present only when a full page was returned, indicating more cards may exist. Pass back as `before` to paginate.

**Pagination example:**
```
list_cards(board_id="b1", limit=50)         # → 50 cards + next_before="cZ"
list_cards(board_id="b1", limit=50, before="cZ")  # → next 50 + maybe next_before
# Continue until response has no next_before.
```

## Requirements

- `autohive-integrations-sdk` - The Autohive integrations SDK

## API Information

- **API Version**: v1
- **Base URL**: `https://api.trello.com/1`
- **Authentication**: API Key + Token
- **Documentation**: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/
- **Rate Limits**:
  - Free accounts: 300 requests per 10 seconds per API key
  - Requests are rate-limited per token, per API key

## Important Notes

- API Key and Token are passed as query parameters in all requests
- Card descriptions and comments support Markdown formatting
- Position values can be "top", "bottom", or a positive number
- Member IDs and Label IDs should be provided as arrays when creating or updating cards
- All date/time values should be in ISO 8601 format
- IDs in Trello are alphanumeric strings (not numeric GIDs like Asana)

## Testing

Unit tests (mocked, CI-safe, no credentials required):

```bash
pytest trello/tests/test_trello_unit.py
```

Live integration smoke tests (opt-in; require real Trello credentials):

```bash
export TRELLO_API_KEY=your_api_key
export TRELLO_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
pytest trello/tests/test_trello_integration.py -m integration
```

The integration tests are skipped automatically if `TRELLO_API_KEY` / `TRELLO_API_TOKEN` are unset, and they never run in CI (the project's default pytest discovery only picks up `test_*_unit.py`).

## Version History

- **2.1.0**
  - Added `get_card_attachments` action — list all attachments on a card with optional `cover` filter.
  - Fixed `list_cards` pagination cursor to use `min(ids)` instead of `cards[-1]["id"]`, preventing incorrect cursors when cards are in board/list position order rather than creation order.
- **2.0.0**
  - Upgraded to `autohive-integrations-sdk ~= 2.0.0`.
  - `context.fetch()` now returns a `FetchResponse`; all handlers were updated to read `response.data` and to check `response.status` so non-2xx responses no longer silently look successful.
  - **Breaking:** handlers now return `ActionError(message=...)` on failure instead of `{ "result": false, "error": "..." }`. Success payloads no longer carry `result: true`. Output schemas were updated to match.
  - Added `search_cards` action backed by `GET /1/search`. Translates `card_name` into Trello's `name:"..."` operator, accepts an advanced `query`, defaults to `is:open` (skipped when the user already specifies `is:open|closed|archived`), and limits results (default 10).
  - `list_cards` now uses Trello's server-side `limit` + `before`/`since` cursor pagination on `/lists/{id}/cards` and `/boards/{id}/cards`, and returns a `next_before` cursor when more results are likely available. Default limit is 50; max 1000. Compact default field set; field projection is enforced client-side.
  - `delete_card` now returns `{ "deleted": true, "card_id": "..." }` on success.
  - Added unit test suite at `tests/test_trello_unit.py` covering the v2 contract, ActionError on non-2xx, the `is:open` injection logic, slicing, and field projection.
- **1.0.0** - Initial release with 17 actions
  - Members: get_current_member (1 action)
  - Boards: create, get, update, list (4 actions)
  - Lists: create, get, update, list (4 actions)
  - Cards: create, get, update, delete, list (5 actions)
  - Checklists: create_checklist, add_checklist_item (2 actions)
  - Comments: add_comment (1 action)
