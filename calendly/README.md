# Calendly Integration for Autohive

Connects Autohive to the Calendly API v2 for managing scheduled events, event types, invitees, availability, and webhooks.

## Description

This integration provides comprehensive access to Calendly's scheduling platform. It allows users to view event types, retrieve scheduled events, manage invitees, check availability, configure webhooks, and work with routing forms programmatically.

The integration uses Calendly REST API v2 with OAuth 2.0 authentication and implements 20 actions covering all major Calendly read operations and event management.

## Setup & Authentication

This integration uses **OAuth 2.0** authentication for secure access to your Calendly account.

### Authentication Method

Calendly OAuth 2.0 does not use traditional scopes. Once authenticated, API access is determined by the user's subscription level:
- **Free**: Access to most GET endpoints (users, event types, scheduled events, invitees, availability)
- **Standard+**: Access to webhooks and advanced features
- **Teams/Enterprise**: Access to organization-level features and routing forms

### Setup Steps in Autohive

1. Add Calendly integration in Autohive
2. Click "Connect to Calendly" to authorize the integration
3. Sign in to your Calendly account when prompted
4. Review and authorize the requested permissions
5. You'll be redirected back to Autohive once authorization is complete

The OAuth integration automatically handles token management and refresh.

## Action Results

All actions return a standardized response structure:
- `result` (boolean): Indicates whether the action succeeded (true) or failed (false)
- `error` (string, optional): Contains error message if the action failed
- Additional action-specific data fields
