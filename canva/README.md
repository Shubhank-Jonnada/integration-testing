# Canva Integration

Comprehensive Canva integration for managing assets, designs, and folders through the Canva Connect API.

## Overview

This integration provides full access to Canva's Connect API, enabling workflows to:
- Manage and organize assets (images, videos, audio)

## Authentication

This integration uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for secure authentication. The following scopes are requested:

- `asset:read` - View asset metadata
- `asset:write` - Upload, update, and delete assets
- `design:content:read` - View design contents
- `design:content:write` - Create designs
- `design:meta:read` - View design metadata
- `folder:read` - View folder metadata and contents
- `folder:write` - Create, update, and delete folders

## Actions

## Use Cases

### Content Creation Automation
- Automatically create Canva designs from templates
- Upload marketing assets from external sources
- Export designs in multiple formats for distribution

### Asset Management
- Organize uploaded assets into folders
- Tag assets for easy discovery
- Maintain a centralized asset library

### Design Organization
- Organize designs and assets into folder structures
- Move items between folders for workflow management
- Track and search designs by title and modification date

### Design Workflow Integration
- Export designs to various formats (PDF, PNG, PPTX)
- Move designs between folders based on approval status
- Track design creation and modification timestamps

## Error Handling

On success, each action returns its output data directly. When an action fails, it raises an `ActionError` whose message describes the failure (e.g. an invalid ID, missing permissions, or an upstream API error). Autohive surfaces this error to the workflow so it can be handled or retried.

## Pagination

Actions that return lists (list_designs, list_folder_items) support pagination using continuation tokens. When a response includes a `continuation` field, pass it to the next request to retrieve the next page of results.

## Async Operations

Asset uploads and design exports are asynchronous operations. Use the corresponding status-check actions (get_asset_upload_status, get_export_status) to poll for completion.

## Rate Limiting

The Canva Connect API implements rate limiting. This integration handles rate limits automatically through the SDK's error handling and retry mechanisms.

## Version History

- **2.0.0** - Upgraded to Autohive Integrations SDK 2.0.0
  - `context.fetch()` now returns a `FetchResponse`; all response access uses `.data`
  - Failures raise `ActionError` instead of returning `result`/`error` fields in the output
  - No change to action behaviour, inputs, or outputs (other than dropping the internal `result`/`error` fields)
- **1.0.0** - Initial release with asset, design, and folder management actions
