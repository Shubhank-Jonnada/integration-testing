# AWS Integration for Autohive

AWS security and monitoring integration covering Security Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail.

## Description

This integration provides access to core AWS security and monitoring services for investigating security findings, monitoring infrastructure metrics and logs, and auditing API activity. It uses boto3 directly with custom authentication (AWS access keys) and implements 22 actions across 6 service areas.

**Services covered:**
- **AWS Security Hub** -- Centralized security findings and compliance insights
- **Amazon GuardDuty** -- Threat detection and finding management
- **Amazon Inspector** -- Direct vulnerability findings, without Security Hub's forwarding lag
- **Amazon CloudWatch Metrics & Alarms** -- Infrastructure metrics, alarms, and alarm history
- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** -- Log group discovery and log event search
- **AWS CloudTrail** -- API activity auditing and trail configuration

## Setup & Authentication

This integration uses **custom authentication** with AWS IAM credentials.

### Prerequisites

1. An AWS account with the services you plan to use enabled (Security Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector, etc.)
2. An IAM user with programmatic access (access key ID and secret access key), or temporary STS credentials (access key ID, secret access key, and session token)

### Creating IAM Credentials

1. Sign in to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Go to **Users** and select or create a user for Autohive
3. Under the **Security credentials** tab, click **Create access key**
4. Select **Third-party service** as the use case
5. Copy the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** (the secret is only shown once)

### Setup Steps in Autohive

1. Add the AWS integration in Autohive
2. Enter your **AWS Access Key ID**
3. Enter your **AWS Secret Access Key**
4. Enter your **AWS Region** (e.g. `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-southeast-2`)
5. If using temporary (STS) credentials — an access key ID starting with `ASIA` — also enter the **AWS Session Token**. Leave it blank for long-term IAM user credentials.
6. Save and start using the integration actions

### Required IAM Permissions

For read-only access to most of this integration, attach the **SecurityAudit** AWS managed policy to the IAM user. This covers all read actions across Security Hub, GuardDuty, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch Logs, plus `list_inspector_findings` (`inspector2:ListFindings`).

> **Note:** `SecurityAudit` does **not** include `inspector2:BatchGetFindingDetails`, so `get_inspector_finding_details` will fail with `AccessDeniedException` under `SecurityAudit` alone — confirmed in testing. Either attach the AWS managed policy **`AmazonInspector2ReadOnlyAccess`** instead/in addition, or add `inspector2:BatchGetFindingDetails` explicitly via the custom inline policy below.

For the four write/extra-permission actions in this integration, add a custom inline policy with these additional permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "securityhub:BatchUpdateFindings",
                "guardduty:ArchiveFindings",
                "cloudwatch:SetAlarmState",
                "inspector2:BatchGetFindingDetails"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Summary of permissions:**

| Policy / Permission | Covers |
|---|---|
| `SecurityAudit` (managed policy) | All read actions across Security Hub, GuardDuty, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch Logs, plus `list_inspector_findings`. Does **not** cover `get_inspector_finding_details`. |
| `AmazonInspector2ReadOnlyAccess` (managed policy) | `get_inspector_finding_details` action (includes `inspector2:BatchGetFindingDetails`) |
| `securityhub:BatchUpdateFindings` | `update_finding_workflow` action |
| `guardduty:ArchiveFindings` | `archive_findings` action |
| `cloudwatch:SetAlarmState` | `set_alarm_state` action |
| `inspector2:BatchGetFindingDetails` | `get_inspector_finding_details` action (alternative to `AmazonInspector2ReadOnlyAccess` via the custom inline policy above) |

## Action Results

Each action returns action-specific data fields in `result.result.data` on success. If an action fails, it returns an `ActionError` — `result.type == ResultType.ACTION_ERROR` and the error message is available at `result.result.message`.

### Amazon Inspector (2 actions)

#### `list_inspector_findings`
List and filter vulnerability findings directly from Amazon Inspector. Unlike `get_findings` (Security Hub), this queries Inspector's own findings database, so it isn't subject to Security Hub's forwarding lag. Results are sorted by severity (highest first) and limited to `ACTIVE` findings by default, matching the Inspector console's default view (CLOSED/SUPPRESSED findings are excluded unless requested).

**Inputs:**
- `filter_criteria` (optional): Amazon Inspector2 `filterCriteria` (e.g. resourceType, severity, findingType filters)
- `status` (optional): Filter by finding status. One of `ACTIVE`, `SUPPRESSED`, `CLOSED`, `ALL`. Defaults to `ACTIVE`. Use `ALL` to include closed/suppressed findings too. Ignored if `filter_criteria` already sets `findingStatus`.
- `last_hours` (optional): Shortcut filter — only return findings first observed (newly discovered) within the last N hours. Cannot be combined with `next_token`, since each call would recompute the window from "now" and desync it from the paginated request — pass an explicit `filter_criteria.firstObservedAt` range instead when paginating past the first page.
- `sort_criteria` (optional): Criteria for sorting results — `field` (e.g. `SEVERITY`, `FIRST_OBSERVED_AT`, `LAST_OBSERVED_AT`) and `sortOrder` (`ASC`/`DESC`). Defaults to `SEVERITY` `DESC`.
- `max_results` (optional): Maximum number of findings to return per page (default: 50, max: 100)
- `next_token` (optional): Pagination token from a previous request

**Outputs:**
- `findings`: List of Amazon Inspector findings
- `next_token`: Pagination token for the next page of results

---

#### `get_inspector_finding_details`
Get detailed information about one or more Amazon Inspector findings by ARN. The underlying AWS API accepts at most 10 ARNs per call, so this action automatically batches larger lists and merges the results.

**Inputs:**
- `finding_arns` (required): List of Inspector finding ARNs to retrieve details for (any length; batched internally in groups of 10)

**Outputs:**
- `findings`: List of detailed Amazon Inspector findings
- `errors`: List of finding ARNs that could not be retrieved, with error details

## Requirements

- `autohive-integrations-sdk` - The Autohive integrations SDK
- `boto3` - AWS SDK for Python

## API Information

- **AWS SDK**: boto3
- **Authentication**: IAM access keys (custom auth)
- **Region**: Configured per integration instance
- **Documentation**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/

## Important Notes

- **Region-Scoped**: Each integration instance connects to a single AWS region. To monitor multiple regions, add separate integration instances.
- **Service Enablement**: Security Hub, GuardDuty, and Inspector must be enabled in your AWS account before their actions will work. CloudWatch and CloudTrail are enabled by default.
- **Security Hub vs. Inspector**: Security Hub's `get_findings` returns a forwarded copy of Inspector findings, which can lag behind (or dedupe differently than) what Inspector's own console shows. Use `list_inspector_findings` for the authoritative, real-time view of vulnerability findings.
- **GuardDuty Workflow**: Use `list_detectors` first to get your detector ID, then pass it to `list_guardduty_findings`, `get_guardduty_finding_details`, and `archive_findings`.
- **Write Actions**: Only three actions perform writes: `update_finding_workflow` (Security Hub), `archive_findings` (GuardDuty), and `set_alarm_state` (CloudWatch). All other actions, including both Inspector actions, are read-only.
- **Pagination**: All list actions support pagination via `next_token`. When `next_token` is returned in a response, pass it to the next request to get the next page of results.
- **Time Formats**: All time-based inputs accept ISO 8601 format (e.g. `2024-01-15T00:00:00Z`).

## Common Use Cases

**Security Monitoring:**
- Review Security Hub findings filtered by severity or compliance status
- Investigate GuardDuty threat detections and archive resolved findings
- Update finding workflow status to track remediation progress

**Infrastructure Monitoring:**
- Query CloudWatch metrics for EC2, RDS, Lambda, and other services
- Check alarm states and review alarm history for incidents
- Temporarily set alarm state during maintenance windows

**Log Analysis:**
- Search CloudWatch Logs for errors or specific patterns across log groups
- Retrieve log events from specific streams for debugging
- Discover available log groups and their sizes

**Audit & Compliance:**
- Look up CloudTrail events to audit who made API calls and when
- Verify trail configurations and logging status
- Review event selectors to confirm what activity is being recorded
